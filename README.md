## Overview
We identified a major problem for teachers, schools, and school districts: bad gradebook and student management software. Without naming specific software, grading apps can be clunky nad ineffecient; they can even break or have problems saving grades, which obviously can cause a lot of problems for teachers.

Our solution: gradebook software for the modern teacher! To reduce grade entry and calculation time we used angular.js's two-way data binding. Grade averages are calculated in real-time. Students who are "failing," "borderline," or "really failing badly" (below 40%) are color-coded in real-time so that the teacher knows which students are doing poorly. Adding students and assignments is easy. So is removing an assignment, and the grades are updated automatically, of course. 

Designed for teachers by teachers, our software takes the pain out of manual grade entry, assignment averaging and more
